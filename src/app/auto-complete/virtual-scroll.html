    <p>This example demonstrates the virtualization support of the AutoComplete. The component has 150 items bound to it; however, when you open the suggestion list, only few items are loaded based on the popup height, and the remaining items are loaded while scrolling.</p>

    <p>The <code>AutoComplete</code> component supports virtualization, which improves UI performance for large amounts of
        data. To enable virtualization, set the <code>enableVirtualization</code> property to true. When virtualization is
        enabled, AutoComplete doesn't render the entire suggestion data source on initial component rendering. It loads the
        N number of items in the popup on initial rendering and the remaining set number of items will load while scrolling.
        Virtualization works with both local and remote data.</p>
    <p>To perform the virtualization feature in the AutoComplete, the <code>VirtualScroll</code> module has to be injected at the application level.</p>
